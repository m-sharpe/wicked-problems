## Administrative Subdivisions of Mongolia

![](mongolia.png)

This plot demonstrates the national (adm0), provincial (adm1), and district (adm2) boundaries of Mongolia. Names of each province, or aimags, are in blue, with districts subdivided within each state as demonstrated by the thin, white lines. Mongolia has 21 aimags and 331 districts.

As you can see from the plot describing just the districts, Mongolia's administrative boundaries are very conplex and contain a lot of data. These large numbers ultimately made it difficult to continue on with Mongolia as my LMIC for the rest of the semester as it took a long time and a lot of computational power to process all data. Therefore, for the rest of the semester, I focused on Ghana. With fewer provinces/districts, this switch simplified and quickened the processing of data.
