## Administrative Subdivisions of Mongolia

![](mongolia.png)

This plot demonstrates the national (adm0), provincial (adm1), and district (adm2) boundaries of Mongolia. Names of each province, or aimags, are in blue, with districts subdivided within each state as demonstrated by the thin, white lines. Mongolia has 21 aimags and 331 districts.

As you can see from the plot describing just the districts, Mongolia's administrative boundaries are very conplex and contain a lot of data. These large numbers ultimately made it difficult to continue on with Mongolia as my LMIC for the rest of the semester as it took a long time and a lot of computational power to process all data. Therefore, for the rest of the semester, I focused on Ghana. With fewer provinces/districts, this switch simplified and quickened the processing of data. 

## Population of Ghana's regions

![](ghana2019.png)

The above plot and chart demonstrate the population density in Ghana within its regional boundaries. Much smaller than Mongolia, Ghana has only 10 regions, their eqivalent to Mongolias aimags. The highest densities are within the Ashanti region and Greater Accra -- the historical/cultural center and modern trading hub. In general, there is a higher density towards the southern part of the country as this is where Ghana borders the ocean. In the north lies the Saharah desert, a less habitable and more formidable climate to live in.

The histogram above describes the most common population numbers in Ghana. This histogram helps confirm what is shown in the plot and chart above, as very few areas are very densily populated, instead, most are faily lowly populated. The two bars to the very right are clearly the Greater Accra and Shanti regions, while the majority of population numbers are much lower.

## Ghana population means

Below are three plots describing:
1. The predicted mean population of Ghana 
2. The difference between my predicted results of the mean population and 2015 estimates
3. A 3D model of plot 2

Note: Though for most the most accurate plots are the one that have the log of population as the response variable and mean of covariates as predictors, for Ghana, the plots with the least error are the plots whose response variable is simply the population as the mean of covariates are the predictors. I know this because the error found by the cellStats() command has significantly less error for the population found my mean (13708950) than the plots demonstrating population by sum (16805209) and log of population by mean (16351012).
